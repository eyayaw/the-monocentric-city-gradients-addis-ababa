# Testing the gradient predictions of the monocentric city model in Addis Ababa

> [!NOTE]
>
> This repo contains replication code and data for the paper [Beze
> (2024)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4803607).

## Requirements

- R 4.3.3

> The necessary R packages are listed in the `renv.lock` file. You can
> install them by running the following command in the R console:
>
> ``` r
> # renv::init() # to initialize renv on the project if you don't clone the repo
> renv::restore()
> ```

- Python 3.12

> The necessary Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt`
> file. You can install them with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):
>
> ``` bash
> uv pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

- The order in which the scripts should be run is provided in
  [script/main.sh](./script/main.sh).

## Data

The data used in the analysis constitutes two main parts: real estate
data and building footprint data.

### Housing data

> [!WARNING]
>
> The repository currently contains no data. However, the data will be
> made available soon. If you urgently need the data, please send me an
> email.

The primary dataset for the analysis is constructed from
[data/housing/processed/listings_cleaned.csv](data/housing/processed/listings_cleaned.csv),
a cleaned version of the scraped data from all providers. The raw data
is available in [data/housing/raw](data/housing/raw) for the providers
included in the analysis. Missing attributes in the dataset are imputed
using `gemini pro`, and the imputed data can be found in
[data/housing/processed/structured/tidy](data/housing/processed/structured/tidy/).
Finally, property addresses are geocoded using [Google Places
API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service)
and [OSM nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html).
The georeferenced data is available in
[data/housing/processed/tidy/listings_cleaned_tidy\_\_geocoded.csv](data/housing/processed/tidy/listings_cleaned_tidy__geocoded.csv).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> During web scraping, I tried to respect the `robots.txt` file of the
> website. See the contents in
> [data/housing/robots_txt](data/housing/robots_txt/).

  Settlement Footprint [(WSF)
  3D](https://geoservice.dlr.de/web/maps/eoc:wsf3d) and [WSF
  2019v1](https://download.geoservice.dlr.de/WSF2019/) datasets.
